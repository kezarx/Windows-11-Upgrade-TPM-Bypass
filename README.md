# Windows-11-Upgrade-TPM-Bypass
There are two files the .reg file need to run first this will add the regkey to bypass TPM requirement, RAM, CPU, and Secure boot checks. Once the Reg key are added you can run the setup.exe to upgrade to windows 11.

NOTE: the setup.exe was made using rufus to bypass TPM 

I have this script because even though the rufus ISO was made with bypasstpm on some machine it didnt work there for I had to add the regkey
